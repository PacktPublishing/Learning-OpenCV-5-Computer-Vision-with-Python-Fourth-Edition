    "This Jupyter Notebook allows you to interactively edit and run a subset of the code samples from the corresponding chapter in our book, *Learning OpenCV 5 Computer Vision with Python 3*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any Jupyter server should be capable of running the Notebook, even if the sample input images files are not available in the server's local filesystem. For example, you can run the Notebook in Google Colab by opening the following link in your Web browser: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-5-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Fourth-Edition/blob/main/chapter05/chapter05.ipynb. Specifically, this link opens the Notebook's latest version, hosted on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional code samples and instructions, please refer to the book and to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-5-Computer-Vision-with-Python-Fourth-Edition. Bear in mind that many of the book's code samples involve camera input or video input/output, which is not well suited to the Jupyter server environment, so there is more to explore beyond Jupyter!\n",
